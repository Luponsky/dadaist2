# Introduction to Dadaist2

## Features

Dadaist is a simple and modular toolkit to streamline the generation of
plots and analyses for microbiome studies, based on the popular DADA2
algorithm for reads denoising.

What makes Dadaist an interesting alternative to other suites is the focus on reproducible downstream analyses (thanks to the automatic generation of a PhyloSeq object and the preparation of files ready to be analysed with MicrobiomeAnalyst or Rhea)
